## <a id="3541-8"></a>3541.8

**Release Date**: March 10, 2018

* Bump bosh-agent to 2.67.1
	* Agent will now respect previously set permissions and owner on sys/run, sys/log and data job directories
	* This should fix stemcell compatibility with Diego/Garden if Agent restarts
		* If you were using 3541.x stemcell for any of your deployments, it's recommended to update your deployments to this version before updating Director since that would cause Agent restart
