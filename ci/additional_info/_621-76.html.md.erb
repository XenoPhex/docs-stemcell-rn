## Known Issue:
If you use the NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP) tile v3.0.1 or earlier, do not upgrade to stemcell 621.76. 621.76 is not compatible with the NCP tile v3.0.1 and causes the openvswitch job to fail when you deploy. Please upgrade the NCP tile to 3.0.2 before updating to stemcell 621.76 or newer.
