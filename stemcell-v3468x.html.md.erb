### <a id='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 Addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
For more information about Meltdown, see the [Meltdown and Spectre Attacks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/meltdown-spectre-attacks/) blog post.
[USN-3522-2](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/usn-3522-2/) addresses the critical vulnerability in Ubuntu associated with Meltdown.

This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to this stemcell, monitor your <%= vars.product_name  %> VM's current CPU and memory usage and scale those components if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, Pivotal recommends scaling that VM.
For information about the performance impact of Meltdown-related stemcell patches on <%= vars.product_name  %> components and guidance on scaling, see this [KB article](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000309953).

For more information about monitoring and scaling <%= vars.product_name  %>, see the [Monitoring <%= vars.product_name  %> VMs from Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/monitoring.html),
[Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html),
and [Scaling PAS](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topics. Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors.
Pivotal recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
